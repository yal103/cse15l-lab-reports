This is a quick tutorial on how to log into a course-specific account on `ieng6` and connect to a remote computer over the internet.

---

### SETUP
1. Find your CSE 15L course-specific account [here](<https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php>). Use this [guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17IDZn8Qq7Q0RkYMxdiIR0o6HJ3B5YqSW/view?usp=share_link) to reset your password.
    > Note that it may take several minutes for the password reset to take effect.
2. Open Visual Studio Code. If you don't already have it downloaded, download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

   The window should look something like this.

3. *Skip to Step 4 if you are on MacOS.* If you are using a **Windows** device, make sure that you have 'git' downloaded.

    [Download Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)

    After installing git, follow the these [steps](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50527994) to set your default terminal to use 'git bash' in Visual Studio Code.

4. Open a terminal in Visual Studio Code.
    - On **MacOS**, press control + ` , or use the menu option Terminalâ†’New Terminal.
    - On **Windows**, press Ctrl + ` .

### CONNECTING REMOTELY
1. In the terminal, type the command `ssh` followed by your CSE 15L course-specific account and press enter. \
For example: \
    ```$ ssh cs15lsp23mh@ieng6.ucsd.edu```
2. If this is your first time you are connecting to the server on your device, you will likely receive a message like this:

    ```
    The authenticity of host 'ieng6-202.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established. 
    RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
    ```
    Type `yes` and press enter.

3. You will be asked to enter the password to your CSE 15L course-specific account.
    > Note: What you type will not visibly appear in the terminal but will be inputed.

4. Once you are successfully logged in, your terminal should display something like this.

    <img src="Login.png" width="55%" length="55%"> 
    
    Your terminal is now connected to a computer in the CSE basement! Any commands you run on your terminal will run on that computer.

### RUNNING COMMANDS
Here is a list of commands you can try running on both **your computer** and the **remote computer**:
```
1. cd

2. cd ~

3. ls

4. ls -lat

5. ls -a

6. ls <directory> where "<directory>" is
    "/home/linux/ieng6/<course>/<username>" where "<course>" is the name of your
    CSE 15L course (eg. cse15lsp23) and "<username>" is your course-specific username (eg. cs15lsp23mh)
    
7. cp /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt ~/

8. cat /home/linux/ieng6/cs15lsp23/public/hello.txt
```
**NOTE: Code Block does not appear in PDF version.**

Here is an example of a combination of the above commands:
